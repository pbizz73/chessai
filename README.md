# ChessAI

**Project Status:** In Progress  
**Current Focus:** Enhancing Chess GUI and Developing AI Bot

## Overview

ChessAI is an ongoing project aimed at creating a chess-playing bot utilizing machine learning techniques. The project is currently in the development phase, with significant advancements in the graphical user interface (GUI) and the foundational AI model. The bot is being trained using evaluation data from Lichess, focusing on improving its decision-making capabilities.

## Current Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A basic chessboard interface has been implemented, allowing users to interact with the game visually.
- **Chess Bot:** A rudimentary AI bot has been developed, capable of making moves based on evaluation data. Current approximate ELO rating is 1000. 
- **Training Dataset:** The bot is being trained using Lichess evaluation data, aiming to enhance its performance over time.

## Future Plans

- **Enhanced AI Model:** Incorporate advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the bot's decision-making process, especially when it comes to end game behavior and finding checkmates. 
- **User Interaction:** Develop features to allow users to play against the AI, with options for different difficulty levels.
- **Game Analysis:** Implement functionality for analyzing games and providing feedback to users.
